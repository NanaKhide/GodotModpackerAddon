# GodotModpackerAddon
This is an Addon for Godot that allows you to pack a scene into a .pck file. I wrote this for my game but have changed the way I structure mods now, therefore i will leave it here for anyone who might need something similar.
- Since this addon was made for my project specifically you will have to change the code for it until I rewrote it to be more generic.

# Usage:
Download the folder and drop it into your Godot project under res://addons, then enable the addon in your project settings.
This should open a new dock that allows you to specify data for the packer.
This data does not do anything yet besides generating the name for the new PCK file.

# Future changes:
- I will make this addon more generic so it is not specific for my project
